## Requirements
- Python 3.9
- Firefox (Geckodriver)
- Required libraries (see `requirements.txt`)


## Before running fix the following: 
1. Make sure you have firefox browser installed in your system. 

2. Install gecko driver and add to path.

## Step 1: Download Geckodriver
Visit the Geckodriver releases page.

Download the appropriate version for your operating system:

Windows: geckodriver-vX.X.X-win64.zip

macOS: geckodriver-vX.X.X-macos.tar.gz

Linux: geckodriver-vX.X.X-linux64.tar.gz

Extract the downloaded archive to a folder of your choice.

## Step 2: Add Geckodriver to PATH
### Windows:
Extract the geckodriver.exe from the downloaded .zip file.

Move the geckodriver.exe to a location (e.g., C:\geckodriver\).

Add this location to your systemâ€™s PATH:

Open the Start menu, search for Environment Variables, and select Edit the system environment variables.

In the System Properties window, click Environment Variables.

In the System variables section, find the Path variable and click Edit.

Click New, and add the path where geckodriver.exe is located (e.g., C:\geckodriver\).

Click OK to save and exit.

### macOS/Linux:
Extract the geckodriver from the .tar.gz file.
Move the binary to /usr/local/bin:

```
sudo mv geckodriver /usr/local/bin/
```
Ensure that /usr/local/bin is part of your PATH (which it typically is by default). You can verify this by running:
```
echo $PATH
```
If /usr/local/bin is not in your PATH, you can add it by editing your shell configuration file (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, etc.):
```
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
```
Save the file and run source ~/.bashrc (or source ~/.zshrc) to apply the changes.

## Step 3: Verify Installation
To confirm that geckodriver is correctly installed, run the following command in your terminal:
```
geckodriver --version
```
If everything is set up correctly, it should display the installed Geckodriver version.


## Now set up your firefox user profile and add to the code 


1. Firefox Profile Path :

Modify the Firefox profile path in the script to point to a valid Firefox profile on your Windows machine:

Open Firefox.
In the address bar, type about:profiles and press Enter.

Locate the path of your active profile under Root Directory. It will look something like 
C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\<random-string>.default-release.

Copy this path and update the PATH_TO_FIREFOX_PROFILE variable in solve_recaptcha.py with the correct profile path.

```
PATH_TO_FIREFOX_PROFILE = r"C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\<random-string>.default-release"
```


## Installation
1. Clone the repository

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download and set up Geckodriver:
   - Download Geckodriver from the official website: [Geckodriver Releases](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)
   - Extract the downloaded archive and add the path to the `geckodriver` executable to your system's PATH environment variable.

## Usage
- Run `solve_recaptcha.py` to solve a single reCAPTCHA challenge:
  ```
  python solve_recaptcha.py
  ```

- Run `test_environment.py` to solve multiple reCAPTCHA challenges and create a log file:
  ```
  python test_environment.py
  ```

## Data
- The training data for the classification task can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19kET6PFXHaHZqzr9DU_ZsgX-n13Ef4sj?usp=sharing).
- The validation data for the classification task can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19kG2NQls2iH1sUq0js0MOArBiJiOmVGM?usp=sharing).

## System Compatibility
Please note that the code in this project was developed and tested on macOS M1. While most of the code should be compatible with other operating systems, certain functionalities, such as the VPN script (`vpn.py`), may not work on non-macOS systems. If you encounter any issues running the code on a different operating system, please refer to the documentation of the specific libraries or tools used in the project for guidance on how to set them up for your system.
